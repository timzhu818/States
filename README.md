# Interview Exercise

Welcome and thank you for taking this exercise! We understand that time 
is your most precious resource so we very much appreciate those making 
the investment. We hope those taking this exercise find the problem set 
engaging, without trick questions and a good barometer of an every day 
problem solved at work.

## Context

This exercise involves evaluating the existing project and resolving any 
open TODO items.

## Time Expectations

You will have a few days between receiving this exercise and the due 
date. Feel free to take your time, digest the problem and work at a pace 
and style that is suitable to you and your schedule.

## Ambiguity

While we're trying our best clearly define expectations for each 
question, there is likely to be some ambiguity. This is OK. Don't worry! 
We understand that development is a creative process and that rarely are 
all requirements clearly defined and found in an easily digestible 
format. If this happens and you feel yourself caught between two 
decisions, make note of your choices (as code comments or within your 
submission document) and continue on.

## Completely Unsure?

Are you completely stuck/confused/unsure of what the question is asking? 
That's OK! It's likely our fault. If this happens, please email 
[Alex](mailto:a.lementuev@apptentive.com) (Mobile Tech Lead), 
[Twinkle](mailto:twinkle.sharma@apptentive.com) (Android Engineer), 
[Byron](mailto:byron@apptentive.com) (Seattle Team Lead), or 
[Gloria](mailto:gloria@apptentive.com) (Head of HR). We won't judge and 
can hopefully get you moving forward again ASAP.

## Expectations/Considerations

We expect that you write code that you are proud of. This is not a race 
to see who can complete the exercise the fastest or in the fewest lines 
of code. The expectation is that you would write code that is of similar 
quality to your daily work. Aim for code that you would open a 
merge/pull request with and expect it to be approved with minimal review 
feedback.

In an on-site interview, we may ask you to make small alterations to 
some of the code you write in this exercise. This does not mean that you 
should code for an infinite number of unknown use-cases! However, we ask 
that you think about the problem as you're solving for it. Be open to 
new ideas/tweaks/iterations just as any software project would, e.g. 
Avoiding hard coded constants/limitations. What happens if sort order 
changes? etc.

## Schedule

At a high level, this exercise will consist of the following steps:

1. Clone exercise repository. If you're reading this, you've likely 
already completed this step. Otherwise it should be available at 
https://github.com/apptentive-interviewing/interview-exercise-{your-github-name}.
2. Read through this README before coding.
3. Work through and solve each TODO comment, creating a new git commit 
after each one is complete.
4. Follow the submission document for submitting your work.

## Ready?

Once you're ready, open the project in Android Studio to get started!

## Finished? Submission Process

# Submission

Congrats! If you're reading and going through this document, it means 
you've completed the exercise. Well done!

Let's finish up the last bit of bookkeeping and get your work submitted.

## Steps

1. Fill out `solution.md` 
2. Create your final `git` commit with updated `solution.md`
3. Push your local changes to a feature branch
4. Create a pull request to the `master` branch from your feature branch 
containing all your solutions.
